#class reward(nn.module)
#Create a function that initializes the parameters of the neural network
#


#crossEntrophyLoss Function
#Takes in a list called dataBase
#Loops through the given list of trajectories, pass them into the discriminator, append the tuples that are returned to dataBase
#Loops though the dataBase list and calculates the cross entrophy loss
#Returns the cross entrophy loss

#update Function
#A function that updates the policy based on the cross entrophy loss
